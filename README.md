<a href= https://github.com/xul8tr/Checkra1n.py/blob/main/testers.md>Testers</a>

# RUN ALL OF THIS USING ADMIN COMMAND PROMPT

# Preinstall
git from https://git-scm.com/

python from https://python.org
### IMPORTANT
cd to the libusb folder after cloning/downloading and copy **libusb.dll** to c:/windows/system32 and c:/windows/syswow64 (only if 64bit) then run **infinstaller.exe** from libusb folder and install the .inf file by right clicking. AFter that copy **Libusb0.sys** to c:/windows/system32/Drivers and c:/windows/syswow64 (only if 64bit)

# Must do
after cloning cd into the folder and type `python main.py`
type 0 into `$ ` to install dependencies

# Optional (recomended)
Run command prompt as administrator and cd to the folder, type `cpbin` ~ this allows you to run checkra1n from anywhere by typing checkra1n from cmd

# Steps
For the menu, simply follow installation
for the instant checkra1n cd to the folder and type `cpbin.lnk` (allows you to just type checkra1n from anywhere, boot flags not supported yet)
For a bad GUI version cd to the folder and type `python gui.py`
For webra1n (css + html to come soon) cd to the folder and type `python index.py`
